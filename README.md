- [Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) is a convenient method of documentation because it can have nice formatting while still being a plain text file (which allows multiple team members to edit sections and view/merge differences).
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) is a web application for making graphs (e.g. UML).
