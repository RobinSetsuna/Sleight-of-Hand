## Task Management
* What went well?
  * Distributed all tasks at beginning of sprint
  * We have meetings before defining most of the user stories so that we can make sure everyone on the team is on the same page.
  * Had substantial discussion online, keeping everyone up-to-date on the project
* What would you do more/less of?
  * More regular updates on Trello.  Updates were mostly only seen in Slack.  The same progress could not be seen in Trello.
  * More playtests (weekly).  Playtests are extremely important for seeing if what you are developing is good or could use improvements.  We only held playests every 3 weeks or so, which can be improved.
* What would you change entirely?
  * Use something other than Trello.  There were took many tasks to keep track of.  Trello makes it very difficult to work with a large number of user stories.
  * Make impediments optional.  We do not always have impediments.  We should only list an impediment when we actually have one.
* What would you add?
  * Each merge should have at least 2 approvals.  This is to ensure that code being pushed is of quality.

## Team Meetings
* What went well?
  * Tasks were distributed at the end of each meeting sot hat everone knew what tasks they had for the next meeting.
  * Had substantial discussion online, keeping everyone up-to-date on the project
* What would you do more/less of?
  * Physical stanup meetings.  Online ones are ok, but having frequent meeting where we can update each other on tasks gives the opportunity to ask any questions or clarify things.

  * n/a
  
## Version Control
* What went well?
  * Gaining familiarity with GIT proved to be extremely useful
* What would you do more/less of?
  * More thorough code reviews.  Reviews were often approved without looking into the submission too much.  This is extremely imprtant for confirming that pushed work is correct and functional.
* What would you change entirely?
  * Git branches management.  We would like to remove branches that have completed development in order to keep the branch list clean with only features currently being worked on or features that may be owkred on in the future.
* What would you add?
  * n/a
  
## Documentation
* What went well?
  * We have our key features writeen in the design doc in a well-organized manner.
* What would you do more/less of?
  * Make more updates in the design document.  Keep it up-to-date and clear enough for everyone who may being reading it.
* What would you change entirely?
  * n/a
* What would you add?
  * Add a much more detailed architecture design which can be helpful for each programmer to understand the codebase.
  
## Team Organization and Roles
* What went well?
  * Team was extremely self-motivated.  Excited to go and aboce the tasks given for the sprint.
  * All tasks were always finished on time
* What would you do more/less of?
  * More communication over what each person is working on.  Often team members would go rogue and work on whatever they wanted to.
* What would you change entirely?
  * n/a
* What would you add?
  * Have smaller sub-meetings for team members working on a specific section of the codebase.
